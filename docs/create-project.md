# Create a project
Start by organising your project:

1. Decide which videos to use and make sure they are .mp4<br>

    ??? note "Transcoding video files to .mp4"
        <video width="100%"  muted controls>
           <source src="../assets/videos/tutorial/2__add_video_to_project-fast.mp4" type="video/mp4">
           Your browser does not support the video tag.
        </video>

2. Create a folder that contains two subfolders
    - **train:** save some videos that you want to train the model on here
    - **test:** save some videos that you want to test the model on here (i.e. videos that the model has *not* been trained on). These should be new videos, but similar to the training videos in terms of image characteristics 

3. [Start the OCTRON Gui](gui.md)

4. In the **Project** tab, click *Choose* under *Project folder* and navigate to the folder you created in step 1
