# Using the GUI

## Opening the GUI
1. Activate the new environment:
    ```sh
    conda activate octron
    ```
2. Start the GUI:
    ```sh
    octron-gui
    ```
    ... and enjoy! 
    On first start this will take a long time to load, since all available models are downloaded once. But subsequent startups will be much quicker.
